# Iceberg (Summer for 2020 Challenge)
Crack the Iceberg by answering questions with strangers!

# What does it do?
This is for all people, introverts and extroverts, to meet new friends through cracking the ice with answering and discussing questions.
Every day, there will be questions published to a page, and users will answer them. Then, users browsing each other's answers can see who they 
agree (or disagree) with, and have a conversation that helps break the ice!

# Goal for this app:
* Design navigation flow
* Implement authentication via firebase
* Implement profiles
* Create a messaging system
* Lots more to come once I get there
